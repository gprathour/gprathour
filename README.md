# Hello World!! ðŸ‘‹

I am A Programmer (by choice and Engineer by chance), An Author (Book titled as "The Way to Core of Java") and more about me might be coming soon...

The very first quote that I could think of, and I liked is,

**"Coding is not only for software development, it's a passion."**

Just starting here to explore and trying to contribute (if I could anything meaningful).

I am into Java, Android, React Native, Node.js, React.js etc.

If you would like to connect with me via social networks also then,

Ah, and why to forget our one and only [StackOverflow][4].
